      Hey guys, I'm Morgan. My plan is to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. I
      have some experience with this kind of stuff, but I thought I should
      finish my degree while I can. I feel confident in building the websites,
      but I hope I can become more comfortable with designing them by the end of
      this course.
    </p>

      As far as hobbies go, I love to watch soccer, specifically the English
      Premier League. The team I support is Manchester United (it's a rough
      season). Other than that, I like to read and hangout with friends when I
      can.
